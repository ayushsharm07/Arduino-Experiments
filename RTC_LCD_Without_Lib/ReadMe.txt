* This is a sketch for using the DS1307 RTC module *WITHOUT* using the RTC library.
 * 
 * 
 *
 *  I wrote this as an experiment and in no way I think, is more optimised. It's more of a "Because, when you can, why not" type of (fling) thing.
 *  I commented almost every line of the code for ease. If that's annoying, Sorry !!!
 * 
 * Suggestions and edits are welcome.
